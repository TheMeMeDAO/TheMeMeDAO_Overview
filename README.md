# MeMeDAO

&nbsp;MeMeDAO is a DAO for investing in MeMe tokens.

&nbsp;The mission of MeMeDAO is to let everyone enjoy the dividends of the blockchain in the blockchain world.
In the real society, the gap between the rich and the poor is gradually increasing, and it is more and more difficult for people to achieve financial freedom. MeMeDAO decides to invest in blockchain projects through the proposal of token holders to realize income, and then repurchase token projects or realize income dividends to make holders profit.


# How it works

&nbsp;The DAO is fully community led.Everyone who holds the token can participate in the proposal, and everyone is equal in MeMeDAO.

&nbsp;We have prepared an initial governance model for the DAO, as shown in the image below, which can be approved by our first vote. First, community members will share draft proposals in the forum for community discussion. This proposal template should be used.

&nbsp;Following community discussion, the proposal will be reviewed by the consensus unit. Their job is to screen proposals to see if they will yield benefits to token holders before they are published on the snapshot. If the consensus group believes that the proposal may have significant potential risks, they may reject the proposal

&nbsp;If the proposal is accepted by the consensus unit, it will be added to the snapshot.
